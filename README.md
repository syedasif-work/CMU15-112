# CMU15-112
Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science Carnegie Mellon University Fall 2020
At the end of the course, students should be able to:
      Write clear, robust, and efficient code in Python using:
      sequential, conditional, and loop statements
      strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
      objects and classes
      recursive approaches
      graphics and interaction
      Develop programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:
      employing modular, top-down design in program construction
      demonstrating an effective programming style based on established standards, practices, and guidelines
      proactively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code
      applying computational problem-solving skills to new problems, especially in the student's home academic discipline
      explaining and analyzing the efficiency of algorithms, particularly by predicting the Big-O running time of small pieces of code
      Design and write a substantial (500-1500 line) program in Python with minimal guidance
